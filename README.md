# Brewery Locator & Random Joke Generator

## Description

Using an API to locate breweries by city and another API to generate a random joke, we have created the Brewery Locator & Random Joke Generator application. The user will enter a location into the search bar and select a brewery from the list provided. Then they will select a joke from the random joke generator.

## Technology Used

This application was created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Local Storage, and the following APIs:

https://api.openbrewerydb.org/v1/breweries?by_city

https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api

## Usage

To use, first enter a city into the search bar and the number of breweries that you would like to see located in or near that city. If either field is left blank, a message will pop-up prompting you to provide a response. From the list of breweries that are provided, you can click to select the one that you would like to go to. Next, you will be prompted to generate a random joke. Once the joke is generated, you will be asked if this is the joke that you would like to use, or if you would like to have a new joke generated. Once a brewery and a joke are selected, your final choices will display on the screen.

The Brewery Locator & Random Joke Generator can be accessed via the following link: https://marinadelconte.github.io/BreweryLocator/
